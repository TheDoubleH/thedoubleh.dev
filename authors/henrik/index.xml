My first &lsquo;Real&rsquo; job out of school in 1997 was as a MIS/Production Planning Assistant-guy at a Furniture Manufacurer. They had recently implemented Navision 3.53 running on a IBM RISC/6000, and my job was to manage that, as well as doing minor in-house development.
Little did I know, that thsi would be a beginning to a lifelong career in ERP and Navigator -&gt; Navision -&gt; Microsoft Dynamics 365 BC.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
