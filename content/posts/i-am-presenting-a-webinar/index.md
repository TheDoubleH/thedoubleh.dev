## It started with a tweet

At the end of March I finally convinced myself, that I DO have some things to share for the Developers in our little world. I submitted a session for [BcTechDays](https://bctechdays.com). as of today, I do not know if our session have been accepted or not, but no matter not, I will be in Antwerp.

## It's time

Shortly after I announced on twitter that I had submitted a session, the guys at [Areopa](https://areopa.academy/) reached out to me, and asked me if I would be willing to share a few nuggest in their webinar series. Having watched quite a few of their sessions, I know I have some big shoes to fill, but I agreed. As someone with over 20 years in this world, it really is time for me to step up and share more of my knowledge.

## The Webinar

As a Developer it can be difficult to know how a user may interact with your new feature. Many times, development works “when I try”, but with a slight difference in data or flow, and things can look a lot different.

Business Central have different ways You, as a developer, can help your users; Visual indicators, error messages and standards are all things that You should take into account, when building apps for Business Central.
