### Henrik Helgesen

Born in a small town in Denmark in the middle of a snow storm in 1975. My first 'Real' job out of school in 1997 was as a MIS/Production Planning Assistant-guy at a Furniture Manufacturer. They had recently implemented Navision 3.53 running on a IBM RISC/6000, and my job was to manage that, as well as doing minor in-house development.

Little did I know, that this would be a beginning to a lifelong career in ERP and Navigator -> Navision -> Microsoft Dynamics 365 BC.
