# Meet Me

After being in attendee in several conferences in the NAV / Business Central World for a decade or two, Luc Van Vugt asked me to co-present with him. That lead me to talk about [10 Myths about test automation on customer projects](https://sessionize.com/s/TheDoubleH/10-myths-about-test-automation-on-customer-project/77083) at Directions EMEA in October 2023  in Lyon, France.

Shorty after coming home to Los Angeles, CA I submitted a session for Dynamics CON Live, and was encouraged to submit additional sessions. Thankfully after some conversations with Brad Prendergast (aka @dvlprlife) we ended up getting two sessions approved.

That is how it started. hopefully I will see you at some of the events. Checkout my Sessionize profile [here!](https://sessionize.com/TheDoubleH/)
