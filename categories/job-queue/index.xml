&lt;/div>Perception is RealityAs a Magic Lover and member of the World-Famous Magic Castle in Hollywood, California, I have taken some classes in the art of conjuring. In Magic we often rely on the fact, that Perception is Reality. That is - If People perceive a fact, then it must be so!
The same is true when it comes to users using NAV or Business Central! Over the years, I have often heard people complaining about slow systems, and while in many cases, there are low hanging fruits that can resolve the issues, there are also often times a different approach to the whole thing: Change the User Experience!</description></item></channel></rss>
